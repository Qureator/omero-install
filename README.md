OMERO installation scripts
==========================

Example OMERO installation scripts for [Linux](linux), [Windows](windows) and [Mac OS X](homebrew).
These scripts are provided to help new users with installing OMERO.server for the first time on a clean system, and can be used as the basis for more advanced configurations.

Read the [OMERO System Administrator Documentation](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5/sysadmins/), especially the sections on requirements and installation, before using these scripts.

The Linux and OS X scripts should automatically download all required files, the Windows scripts assume the required files have already been downloaded.
